# OFMT is a formatting and linting tool

* **Formatting** is done solely by prettier. It is completely automated, and not configurable in any way other than changing the [`.prettierrc`](https://github.com/quesabe/ofmt/blob/add-readme/package.json) of this repo, and republishing the package.
* **Linting** is not related to formatting in any way. The goal of linting is to catch early code quality issues, and enforce usage of best practices.

## Install

Use the following command to instal the package as a dev dependency:
```shell
npm install @ottofeller/ofmt --save-dev
```

The package implements an `install` command that copies `prettier` and `eslint` configs to your project - it creates a symlink to `prettier` config file and adds/extends `eslint` config within _package.json_. See the [Examples](#examples) sections for usage details.
> ðŸ’¡ The `install` script does not attempt to overwrite existing `prettier` config - if a _.prettierrc_ file exists it is left as is. An existing `eslint` config is extended with _eslint.quality.cjs_.

## Configs

The project contains the following configs:
- `.prettierrc` formatting rules
- `eslint.quality.cjs` with JS/TS-specific code quality and best practices rules
- `eslint.tailwind.cjs` same as above, CSS-specific

Direct use of configs is meant only for IDE support. For CLI runs use the provided executables.

## Executables

There are two _bin_ files that perform the code checking:
- `ofmt` - prettier formatter. A single option is available:\
  `-l, --lint` - a flag to perform checking only. Without the flag `prettier` will rewrite files with fixed formatting.
- `olint` - code quality and best practices linter.

## Examples:

> ðŸ’¡ The examples below use shorthand executable name as registered in _PATH_ by `npm` - available only if the package is installed in the project or in upper scopes on the search path of `npm`. If the `@ottofeller/ofmt` is not installed append with the package name:\
```bash
npx -p @ottofeller/ofmt [ofmt|olint] ...
```

#### Check TS files with `prettier`
```bash
npx ofmt -l './src/**/*.ts'
```

#### Fix TS files with `prettier`
```bash
npx ofmt './src/**/*.ts'
```

#### Install `prettier` and `eslint` configs to your project
```bash
npx ofmt install .
```
NOTE: if run as _npm-script_ the path will be inferred:
```json
"scripts": {
  "ofmt:install": "ofmt install",
  ...
}
```
```bash
npm run ofmt:install
```

#### Check TS files with `eslint`
```bash
npx olint './src/**/*.ts'
```
